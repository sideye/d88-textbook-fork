    "\n",
    "So far, we have expressed our demand and supply curves using prices as a function of quantity, e.g. $D(Q) = 100 - Q$. This format aligns with the axes of our plots, since quantity is on the x-axis and price is on the y-axis. However, it perhaps makes more sense to switch this around, expressing quantity demanded or supplied as a function of price. Intuitively, the price of a good or service causes the quantity supplied or demanded to alter; at high prices, producers would be willing to supply a great deal of units while few consumers would enter the market, while the opposite is true at low prices.\n",

    "In reality, the demand function is based on the price consumers pay (which we'll denote $P_c$), and the supply function is based on the price producers receive (which we'll denote $P_p$). Hence, the actual demand and supply functions are $D(P_c)$ and $S(P_p)$, so we should be equating:\n",
    "$$D(P_c) = S(P_p)$$\n",
    "In the no-tax scenario, the price received by producers is the same as the price paid by consumers. Hence, we are able to get away by expressing them both as $P$ above, where $P=P_p=P_c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of tax, $P_p$ is no longer equal to $P_c$. Specifically, $P_p+\\text{tax}=P_c$. As a result, to solve for equilibrium with taxes, we can use substitution to express $P_c$ as $P_p+\\text{tax}$, or $P_p$ as $P_c−\\text{tax}$. Hence we actually aim to equate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D(P_c)=S(P_p)\\implies D(P_p+\\text{tax})=S(P_p)\\quad \\text{or} \\quad D(P_c)=S(P_c−\\text{tax})$$\n",
    "Because there are now 3 unknowns ($P_c,P_p,Q$) and 3 equations ($P_p+\\text{tax}=P_c$, supply equation, and demand equation), we conduct this substitution to reduce it to 2 equations and 2 unknowns. Essentially, you'll find that the tax simply was just a shift in the intercepts, which matches our graphical intuition from the diagrams above!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are able to solve for $P_p$ or $P_c$, we can add/subtract the tax to get the other. We can also plug $P_c$ into $D(P_c)$ to get the equilibrium quantity, which should be the same as plugging in $P_p$ into $S(P_p)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to calculate the consumer burden, we seek to measure how much more the consumers are now paying due to the tax. Hence, this value is $P_c−P$, where $P$ is the original price when there is no tax. Similarly, to calculate the producer burden, we seek to measure how much less the producers are now receiving due to the tax; this value is $P−P_p$. "
